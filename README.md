Oregon Trail ported to Oric

To build:
- download OSDK from http://osdk.defence-force.org/
- use the bas2tap program from the osdk bin folder to create the tape file:
bas2tap oregont.bas oregon.tap

This port is based on the 1978 version for CDC CYBER 70/73-26 in 3.1 BASIC, published in "Creative Computing" May-June 1978 issue.
